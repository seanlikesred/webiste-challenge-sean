# webiste-challenge-sean
This is my submission website challenge. This repistory includes the relevant html pages, css stylesheet, and images used in the creation of the site. The general structure of index.html was boostrapped, while the entersite.html page and the menu pages were created from scratch. The logo was found online, and the images came from the courses internet-technologies repo.
